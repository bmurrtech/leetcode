2073. Time Needed to Buy Tickets

2074. This solution efficiently simulates the ticket buying process. The time complexity is O(n*m) where n is the number of people in the queue and m is the maximum number of tickets a person wants to buy. Though not the most efficient in terms of time complexity, given the constraints, this solution works well for the input size specified.

To solve this problem, we'll simulate the process of buying tickets. We keep track of the total time taken and reduce the number of tickets for each person by one in each pass until the person at position k has bought all their tickets. Here's the strategy:

- Initialize a time counter to 0.
- Iterate over the tickets array, reducing the ticket count for each person by one in each iteration (signifying the purchase of a ticket) and incrementing the time counter.
- After each person buys a ticket, check if the person at position k has finished buying their tickets. If so, break out of the loop.
- If a person's ticket count reaches zero, they leave the queue, but since we are iterating over the original array without modifying its structure, we treat it as if the person with zero tickets does not affect the loop anymore (their ticket count cannot go below zero).
Here's how the code looks with these steps:

***python
class Solution:
    def timeRequiredToBuy(self, tickets: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        time = 0  # Initialize the counter to keep track of the time
        while tickets[k] > 0:  # Loop until the person at position k has no tickets left to buy
            for i in range(len(tickets)):  # Iterate through each person in the line
                if tickets[i] > 0:  # If the person has tickets to buy
                    tickets[i] -= 1  # Buy a ticket
                    time += 1  # Increment the time
                if tickets[k] == 0:  # If the person at position k has bought all their tickets
                    return time  # Return the total time taken
        return time  # Just in case, but this line should never be reached as the function returns in the loop
